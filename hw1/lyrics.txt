I can't afford to breathe in this town Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand Hooked back up to my cathode ray I'm better off dead I'm better off dead I'm better off dead I'm better off dead I'm better off dead I'm better off dead I wanna breathe, I wanna throw I say I want it but I don't know how I watch, I bleed, I beg, I pray I'm better off dead I'm better off dead I'm better off dead I wanna breathe, I wanna throw I say I want it but I don't know how I wanna breathe, I wanna throw I say I want it but I don't know how I wanna breathe, I wanna throw I say I want it but I don't know how I'm better off dead I'm better off dead I'm better off dead You knew you said it So why didn't you say it? You said well You knew you said... Thanks for watching!
